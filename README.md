# resume template
I previously wrote my resume with markdown. When I wanted icnreased control over style I thought a simple Next.js app with Tailwindcss would let me easily print my resume to PDF. Eventually I separated content, layout, and style and created this highly flexible template.

*Might add better documentation later.*
